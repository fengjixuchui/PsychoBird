### Hi, I'm Nick // PsychoBird (he/him)

I'm a freshman in college from the United States that's interested in iOS development and jailbreaking. 

My current projects are RevelariOS, a technical and expandable memory scanner meant for developers, Capere, a hooking library for Apple Silicon, and Machium, a debugger for iOS. Recently, I have been researching iOS internals and vulnerabilities with the intention to begin bug hunting. Linked in my profile is my blog where I provide insight into various projects of mine and write about other security related topics. I try to keep it -somewhat- updated. 

My email is on my profile - feel free to reach out.
